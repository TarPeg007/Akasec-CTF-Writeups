Diving into Akasec CTF 2024: A Reverse Engineering Adventure
Introduction
The Akasec CTF 2024 presented an exciting challenge for reverse engineers, offering a series of intricate binary puzzles that tested skills in understanding and manipulating low-level code. This writeup explores the journey through four unique challenges, each presenting its own set of complexities and learning opportunities.
Challenge Breakdown
1. Sperm Rev: The Deceptively Simple Challenge
Difficulty Level: Easy
Key Technique: Strings Analysis
The first challenge taught a critical lesson in reverse engineering: always start with the simplest tools. Many participants, including myself, initially overcomplicated the approach by diving into complex disassembly techniques.
Solving Strategy:

Use the strings command
Extract readable strings from the binary
Identify the flag quickly and efficiently

2. Paranoia: Navigating Randomness
Difficulty Level: Moderate
Key Techniques:

Time-based Random Number Generation
XOR Decryption
Seed Replication

Technical Deep Dive
The challenge leveraged classic C functions to obfuscate the flag:

time(): Returns seconds since the Unix epoch
srand(): Seeds the random number generator
rand(): Generates pseudo-random numbers

Solution Approach:
pythonCopydef solve_paranoia():
    # Replicate exact timestamp
    libc.srand(current_timestamp)
    
    # Reverse XOR encryption
    flag = [chr(rand_value ^ encrypted_char) 
            for encrypted_char in encrypted_flag]
    return ''.join(flag)
3. Grip: Shellcode Decryption Challenge
Difficulty Level: Intermediate
Key Techniques:

Shellcode Analysis
XOR Decryption
Memory Mapping

Solving Methodology:

Extract encrypted shellcode
Use XOR decryption (key: 0xf2)
Analyze memory mapping with mmap()
Utilize CyberChef for decryption

4. Paketa: The Advanced Packing Challenge
Difficulty Level: Advanced
Key Techniques:

Custom Packing Mechanism
RC4 Encryption
ELF Binary Reverse Engineering

Packing Mechanism Breakdown

Encryption Algorithm: RC4
Key Generation: Custom algorithm
Encryption Scope: ELF Binary Sections

Decryption Strategy:
pythonCopydef unpack_elf(packed_binary):
    for potential_seed in range(1, 501):
        key = generate_key_stream(seed=potential_seed)
        decrypted_sections = decrypt_sections(packed_binary, key)
        if validate_decryption(decrypted_sections):
            return decrypted_sections
